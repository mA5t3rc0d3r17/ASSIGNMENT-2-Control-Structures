# Even-Odd Number Checker  

This Python script checks whether a given number is **even** or **odd**.  

## **How It Works**  
1. Takes an integer input from the user.  
2. Uses the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the number is divisible by 2.  
   - If `num % 2 == 0`, the number is **even**.  
   - Otherwise, it is **odd**.  
3. Prints the result.  

## **Usage**  
Run the script using Python:  
```bash
python task1.py

**## **Expected Output**
**
Enter a number: 12
12 is an even number

Enter a number: 7  
7 is an odd number

**## **Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50**
**
This Python script calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50.

**## **How It Works**
**
1. Initializes a variable `sum` to 0 to store the cumulative total
2. Uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 50 (inclusive)
3. In each iteration, adds the current number to the `sum` variable
4. After the loop completes, prints the final sum

**## **Usage**
**
Simply run the script with Python:
```bash
python task2.py

**## **Expected Output**
**
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
